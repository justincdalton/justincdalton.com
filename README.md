=================

This project is my personal landing page, which includes a bit about who I am, as well as contact info and a link to my github account.
I put the site together as a weekend project and it will continue to be a place where I can experiment and try new technologies.

It is built based twitter bootstrap which provides the responsive grid layout and I have the styled the site on top of that with my own LESS markup.
The site interaction is coded with mostly jQuery, as I hoped to provide a simple yet creative UI.

Update - 9/11/2013
----------------------------------------

Just began working on brand new, more thought out design (that I didn't draw up in an hour!), and I am planning to have that out within the next two weeks.

Changelog - 7/8/2013
----------------------------------------

Added a complete projects page which provides a link to github and is used to highlight various projects I have worked on.


Changelog - 4/30/2013
----------------------------------------

My most recent update was to take an evening to move the site into a php framework. I chose Laravel 4 because of it's reputation as a well architectured, completely bundled, and low dependency framework.
I'm not asking it to do too much yet, but overall I am impressed with how easy and fluid it was to setup.

Upcoming changes
---------------------------------------

These are the next few updates I plan to make and technologies I want to use:
* Implement new design
* Implement backbone.js
* ~~Add a full projects page with descriptions and screenshots~~
* Add individual project pages for those I want to highlight
* Further integration with Laravel
